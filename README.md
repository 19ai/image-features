# image-features

(Work in progress)

## Motivation

I am just interested in computer vision at lower resolutions (32x32 or 128x128) for edge AI.

## Development plan
- Motion detection
- Contour extraction
- Counting the number of objects
- Object recognition
         :
         
## My related works

Sensors used for adge AI:
- 9-axis sensor (MEMS)
- Mic sensor (MEMS)
- Infrared array sensor
- Image sensor
